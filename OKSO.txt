OK SO

When should I make a AudioRecord object?
You can reuse a single AudioRecord object for multiple recordings, but it will keep memory used up for that object even when you're not in the record activity

I think we should make a new AudioRecord object at the beginning of Record Activity then kill it at the end of the activity

So this will need to be done in onCreate and onDestroy of RecordActivity

Should the recordComplete method release the audioRecord object?


////////Here's the logic of the record activity://///////
when not recording:
	record should start the recording
	stop record should do nothing
		This means it needs to check if it's recording
	clicking out should do nothing but release the audioRecord object so it doesn't use resources
	
When recording:
	record should restart a new recording, discarding the previous one (only temporary file changed)
	stop record should complete the recording and write it to the permanent file
	clicking out of the activity should interrupt the recording discarding (only temp file changed) as well as release the audioRecord object 

When should the audioRecord object be released?
	only when closing the activity because otherwise we want to keep using the same one and don't want to have to re initialize it again for no reason


/////////// AudioTrack playback logic ////////////
When you click the same sound repeatedly it should interrupt and start over with no overlap
When you click one sound then another they should keep playing and should overlap
Maybe we can make special cases where a sound mutes antoher one like for hi hat closing and opening like mute groups but that's a far ahead future feature



When should I make a AudioTrack object?
Maybe make a new AudioTrack object for each button (not sure if all at once or only after being clicked)
This way when one button is clicked repeatedly, it will have its own single personal AudioTrack object which we can stop and restart


What should I do if I don't get permissions?
